## Description

This is a simple way to find different kinds of cocktails.  Some you have tried before and others that you have never hear of.  There are many variations to just one drink such as a White Wine Sangria, a Red Wine Sangria, and a Sangria Lemonade.  People may have had a Moscow Mule, but not the Champagne Mule.  Some may have had a Tequila Fizz, but not the Gin Fizz or the Vodka Fizz.  I hope you find something you would like to try on your next gathering.  Please, drink responsibly.  Cheers!!

## How To Use

The main page has menu links that take you through the project.  Just enter a liquor type, like Vodka or Rum, in the search to see the chosen cocktails.  There will be no results for Burbon or Liqueur.  There are links to a few accessories or gift items.  I've only chosen a few, but there are plenty more to choose from.  I hope you find something exciting.

There is a page for anyone who may be struggling with alcohol addiction.  Follow the link or talk to a family if you think you need help.  You don't have to go through this alone.
